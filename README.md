### L.B. Stanza RPM spec file

Currently a quick hack of a spec file that does not build the source code but just puts all the files provided by [lbstanza.org](http://lbstanza.org/downloads.html) releases into their proper Fedora locations.

I'm looking into how to best include rpm files with gitlab.
