### L.B. Stanza RPM spec file

Currently a quick hack of a spec file that does not build the source code but just puts all the files provided by [lbstanza.org](http://lbstanza.org/downloads.html) releases into their proper Fedora locations. Also adds a few environment variables for easier shell scripts.

RPM files for x86_64 can be found attached to releases [here](https://github.com/stanza-tools/rpm-spec/releases).
